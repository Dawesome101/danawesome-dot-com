## Description

This site is a personal work of art also designed to showcase my skills and experiences.

## Ideas

- Sign My Wall = a page dedicated to allowing people that visit the site to leave a little something behind.  A signature, a sketch or whatever they want really. I see the potential for griefers to ruin the whole thing so it would need frequent backups and equally frequent supervision to make sure people dont draw dicks and swasticas on it. Could be cool, I'll file it away under stretch goals.
